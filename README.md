# Bossett's little feed collection

Playing around with Bluesky's custom feeds. Very basic - just a small iteration on the template for the moment, to grab a user list, and then look for specific terms in posts from those users.

## Science Feed

Watches for ðŸ§ª posted by people on a set of watchlists (e.g. https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jfhpnnst6flqway4eaeqzj2a/lists/3jx3w32axax2f)

## Major TODOs

Some level of caching needs to go in - possibly just a cache header in feed-generation.ts - not a huge deal right now, but may be important in the future.

## To set up one of your own:

Set up things you'll need on Bluesky:
* Create a mutelist.
    * Add the accounts you want the feed to follow here. (Make sure to get their permission first!)
    * Record its `did`; you'll use this as `env.FEEDGEN_LISTS`.
* Create an app password.
    * Record this; you'll use it as `env.FEEDGEN_PASSWORD`.

Set up your hosting:
* Fork this code to your account.
* Sign up for a digital ocean account, if needed.
* At digital ocean:
    * Create a new app.
    * Authorize it on your forked repo.
    * Update the plan info. (The basic plan is cheapest. You only need one copy of the web service under your app.)
    * Connect it to your mongodb.
    * On the environment variables step:
        * Go to global > bulk editor.
        * Copy-paste `.env.example`.
        * Update it according to the inline comments.
        * `FEEDGEN_HOSTNAME` won't be available until after your first deployment; you'll need to get your deployed app's URL, update the env, and redeploy.
    * Total cost is $10/month.
